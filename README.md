# Block X
A block explorer built for Minima.  Traverse through the chain and search for your TxPoW, Coins and Txns.

### :rocket: Get Started
This is a pre-**MiniDAPP** built using Html, **Materialize** Bootstrap SCSS, Vanilla JS with Jquery.  Included is the **minima.js** script.  

:bellhop_bell: To make this a MiniDAPP, you'll need to use the **MiniDAPP *Tool***.

**1.** Make sure you are running a Minima **node** and you will start receiving your blocks.
**2.** If you will not be converting this to a MiniDAPP to install, you can open it as a regular website by opening the **_index.html_** file.
